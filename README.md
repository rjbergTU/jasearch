# jasearch
A small web application for searching jamendo's database for tracks according to a users specification. It is just a small wrapper around the track api.

Not all features are implemented. It was only meant for personal use. No website has actually hosted this webapp. I only made it to have a more lightweight, clear and specific control over searches on jamendo. For example, filtering on release date.

To use it, just make a directory, put all html/js/css files in it, and open the html in a browser.

JQuery was used to create this wrapper. JQuery is distributed under the MIT License.
